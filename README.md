# The GreenPower

The GreenPower website is my first mini project where I create everything from scratch.

The main goal of this project was to focus on CSS&HTML. I challenged myself to create a nice-looking site.

Technologies: CSS&HTML, JavaScript

At the moment, there are some things which have to be done. However, most are done, responsiveness is added.

- I have to improve how website is displayed on screen larger than 1366px

I will work on smooth scrolling, scrollbar, adding elements or sections dynamically, footer and I have to tidy my js file when I finish everything.

To properly open a link, please copy from line below 'thegreenpower.netlify.app' and do not add prefix 'www.' because 'Your connection is not private' window will be shown and there is no way to omit it.
