# 🌿 The Green Power – Sustainable Energy Solutions

**The Green Power** is a single-page website I originally built when I was first learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a fictional company focused on renewable energy and sustainability.

Recently, I revisited the project to clean it up, apply everything I've learned since then, and bring it up to modern frontend standards.
