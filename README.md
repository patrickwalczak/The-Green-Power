The GreenPower website is my first mini project where I create everything from scratch.

The main goal of this project was to focus on CSS&HTML. I challenged myself to create a nice-looking site.

Technologies: CSS&HTML, JavaScript

At the moment, there are some things which have to be done. However, most are done, responsiveness is added.
* I have to improve how website is displayed on screen larger than 1366px

I will work on smooth scrolling, scrollbar, adding elements or sections dynamically and I have to tidy my js file when I finish everything.
